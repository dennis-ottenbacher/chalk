# Migration Plan: Local Docs to System Artifacts

## Goal Description

The user wants to replace the static `docs/` folder with the "System Artifacts" / "Knowledge Items" which are dynamic and persistent. I will create a central "Index" artifact to serve as the requested "always available overview" and remove the redundant local files.

## Proposed Changes

### System Artifacts (New)

#### [NEW] [workspace_index.md](file:///Users/dennisottenbacher/.gemini/antigravity/brain/e8068d47-02ee-43ac-9958-0bfe221d9d01/workspace_index.md)

Creation of a master index file listing available artifacts and Knowledge Items.

## Verification Plan

1. **Index Access**: Confirm the `workspace_index.md` contains the correct links and information.
